- Platform page ✓
- Why Varity page ✓
- Solutions page ✓
- Pricing page content ✓

#### 64% Cheaper (INCORRECT, NEEDS UPDATE):
- **About page mission statement** ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT**

#### 64-80% Savings (CONTEXT-SPECIFIC):

---

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. INCONSISTENT COST SAVINGS MESSAGING:

**About Page Issue:**
- Current: "64% cheaper"
- Should be: "89% savings" (to match all other pages)

**Pricing Page Headline Issue:**
- Current: "Save 64-80% compared to traditional cloud providers"
- Should be: "Save up to 89% compared to traditional cloud providers"

### 2. DePin Terminology Assessment:

**Current Status:** "DePin" appears on 3 pages (Homepage, Platform, Pricing)

**Recommendation:** If you want to de-emphasize Web3 terminology, consider:
- Replacing "DePin" with "decentralized infrastructure" or "distributed infrastructure"
- The Platform page is heavily blockchain-forward (may be intentional for technical audience)
- Pricing page could remove "(DePin)" parenthetical

### 3. Web3 Positioning:

**Current approach:** Tiered messaging
- Technical pages (Platform, About): Heavy Web3 terminology
- Business pages (Solutions, Contact): Minimal Web3 terminology
- Middle ground (Homepage, Why Varity, Pricing): Moderate mentions

This appears to be an intentional strategy to appeal to both Web3-native and traditional business audiences.

## Recommendations

### HIGH PRIORITY:

1. **Fix About page cost savings claim**
   - Change "64% cheaper" → "89% savings"
   - Update mission statement section

2. **Fix Pricing page headline**
   - Change "Save 64-80%" → "Save up to 89%"

### MEDIUM PRIORITY:

3. **Consider DePin terminology removal** (if de-emphasizing Web3):
   - Homepage: Replace "DePin (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure)" with "distributed infrastructure"
   - Pricing page: Remove "(DePin)" parenthetical

4. **Platform page Web3 assessment:**
   - This is the most blockchain-forward page
   - If targeting traditional businesses, consider softening messaging
   - If targeting Web3 developers, current messaging is appropriate

### LOW PRIORITY:

5. **Contact page:**
   - Already clean and professional
   - Minimal Web3 terminology
   - No changes needed

6. **Solutions page:**
   - Good balance of business value + technical credibility
   - Web3 mentions are subtle and informative
   - No changes needed
